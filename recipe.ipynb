    "### Input Ingredients\n",
    "Allow the user to input a list of ingredients they have.\n",
    "### Recipe Matching\n",
    "Match the input ingredients with a database of recipes to find suitable options.\n",
    "Show recipes that require the least additional ingredients.\n",
    "### Detailed Recipe Display\n",
    "Provide step-by-step instructions, cooking time, and a list of ingredients for the chosen recipe.\n",
    "### Expand Recipe Database\n",
    "Allow users to add new recipes to the database.\n",
